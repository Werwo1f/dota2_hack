DOTA 2 Cheats - maphack + illusion detector + vision detector

Thanks to guidedhacking for your easy to follow tutorials. In just a few months this site has allowed me to create this Dota 2 helper program.

Features:
All particles are rendered (map hack)
A bounding box is drawn on your hero if your hero is seen (great for dewarding!)
Bounding boxes are drawn on non-illusion enemies

How to use:
Create a shortcut on your desktop for x64 Dota
Add -console to the shortcut (e.g., "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\dota 2 beta\game\bin\win64\dota2.exe" -console)
Start game and inject DLL
